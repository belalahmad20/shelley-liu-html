                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over three years ago I arrived in Vancouver from England where I had sold my house. I had
                            nowhere of my own in which to live here. Kevin painstakingly took me around Vancouver and
                            sensibly discouraged me from buying where he knew I would not be happy. He advised, was
                            patient and found me the perfect condo on Duchess Ave which suited me. It was a wise
                            purchase guided by Kevin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due to changing circumstances I decided to sell my condo and rent an apartment. With the
                            good work that was done three years ago by Kevin I asked him and his business partner
                            Shelley to sell my condo. They worked hard. Open houses. Showing agents and their clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was kept informed all the time, step by step what was happening. And I appreciated that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They were pleasant, professional and well informed. They themselves were presentable. They
                            had a proper attitude and approach to all the contacts who were necessary during the process
                            of the sale.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I knew I was in good hands with Shelley and Kevin. Selling and moving is stressful.
                            Physically, emotionally not to mention the large amounts of money involved. They kept me
                            grounded and calm. They were a delight to work with.”
